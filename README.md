# Registration-form
A simple registration form

## Registration Form Design

This repository contains the HTML and CSS code for a simple **Registration Form**.

The form is styled to be clean, centered, and mobile-friendly, using basic CSS properties for layout, padding, borders, and color.

## Features

* **Responsive Design:** Styled to fit within a constrained area (`width: 320px`) for a focused presentation.
* **Clear Structure:** Uses a single `div` (`#div1`) to contain all form elements.
* **Basic Form Fields:** Includes standard inputs for **Name**, **Email**, **Password**, a **Gender** dropdown, a **Bio** text area (implemented as a larger input field), and a green **Submit** button.
* **Centering:** The form container is centered on the page using `display: flex` on the `body`.
